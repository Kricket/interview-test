Guess my secret number! If you can fix the bugs...

## Functional Specification

This is a simple java application that plays a number guessing game. The expected behavior is:
* The game randomly picks a secret number (an integer between 1 and 100)
* The game asks the user to guess its secret number
* The user enters a number
* The game tells the user if their guess was too high or too low, then lets them guess again
* This repeats until the user guesses correctly. At this point, the game tells the user how many tries it took,
then exits

## Getting started

To work on this project, you will need to have Java 8+ and Maven installed.

To play the game, run the main class `com.ineat.App` from the compiled JAR.
